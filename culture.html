<p> Unlike most places in Malaysia, Kelantan is a time capsule that preserves various forms of Malay cultural heritage. Overlooked for decades, the state quietly conceals a treasure trove of cultural gems behind her predominantly Islamic, rural complexion. Kelantan has a unique native dialect that can be hard to understand, even for people who only know standard Malay. But for the local people there, only the real ones would understand one another. Kelantan is the birthplace of many traditional arts in Malaysia, from giant kites to performance art and traditional cuisines. </p>

<h3> Wau Bulan </h3>

<p> Kelantan is commonly associated with the traditional kite called the wau, made from a bamboo frame and colored paper. While there are different types of wau in Malaysia, the Wau Bulan or Moon-Kite is the most well-known and beautiful, with its largest crescent framework and ornate design. </p>

<h3> Wayang Kulit </h3>

<p> Wayang kulit or shadow play is also ingrained in Kelantanese culture. The ancient performance art tells stories through colourful shadow puppets, and is typically accompanied by traditional music. Stories presented are usually mythical and morality tales. There is an educational moral to the plays, which usually portray a battle. Malay shadow plays are sometimes considered one of the earliest examples of animation. The puppets are made primarily of leather and manipulated with sticks or buffalo horn handles. Shadows are cast using an oil lamp or, in modern times, a halogen light, onto a cotton cloth background. They are often associated with gamelan music. </p>

<h3> Mak Yong </h3>

<p> Mak Yong  is a traditional form of dance-drama from northern Malaysia, particularly the state of Kelantan. It was banned by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party because of its animist and Hindu-Buddhist roots which pre-date Islam in the Asian region by far. In 2005, UNESCO declared Mak Yong theatre a "Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity". Mak Yong is considered the most authentic and representative of Malay performing arts because it is mostly untouched by external sources.</p>
